# Add CC App

## Description

Have you ever wanted to allow your end-user to be able to define CC upon a new request? This App will automatically add the end-user requested CCs as soon as an agent picks up the ticket.

The way this App works is by grabbing CCs that have been entered as text by the end user upon submission and adding them as CCs as soon as the first agent opens the ticket. The limitation here is that the CCs aren't added until the ticket is opened for the first time in the Agent interface.

## App location:

* Ticket sidebar (This is a No Template App)

## Set-up/installation instructions:
